Title: Women in Engineering: Then and Now
We interview then-ELGOOG engineer Maria Meyer: 'People ask me all the time: 'What is it like to be a woman at ELGOOG?' I'm not a woman at ELGOOG, I'm a geek at ELGOOG. And being a geek is just great.' Dr. Meyer is now the CEO of OOHAY and wishes that more women were engineers.
