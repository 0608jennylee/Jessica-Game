	Jenny: Hey Jessica! Have you thought about what elective you want to do?
	Jessica: I’m taking the electronics technology and programming classes!
	Jenny: I wish I could do that, but I don’t think I’m good enough. So I’m taking the cooking class....
	-> You are good enough
		Jessica: I believe you’re good enough!
		Jenny: Really? That sounds hard.
		Jessica: Yes! Anyone can learn. And you can do it with me so you won’t be alone.
		Jenny: I’m excited to do it together!
