	Hey Jessica! Have you thought about what elective you want to do?
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	I’m taking the electronics technology and programming classes!
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jenny>>
	I wish I could do that, but I don’t think I’m good enough. So I’m taking the cooking class....
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	-> You are good enough
    	I believe you’re good enough!
        <<change_character DialogueManager Jenny>>
    	Really? That sounds hard.
        <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    	Yes! Anyone can learn. And you can do it with me so you won’t be alone.
        <<change_character DialogueManager Jenny>>
    	I’m excited to do it together!
    	<<change_confidence Player 15>>
	-> My parents said that I should do cooking too.
    	My parents said that I should do cooking too.
        <<change_character DialogueManager Jenny>>
