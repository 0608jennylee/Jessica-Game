	I get to pick a class today, I'm so excited! I want to do the programming class.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Mum>>
	We don't think you should choose the computer class Jessica, it's not feminine!
	<<change_character DialogueManager Dad>>
	Why don't you choose something like cooking instead? Then you'll be able to find a husband more easily.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Mum>>
	Girls aren't good at technical things.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>

	<<change_character DialogueManager Dad>>
	We're here! Now don't be late to class!
