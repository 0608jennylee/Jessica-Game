	I get to pick a class today, I'm so excited! I want to do the programming class.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Mum>>
	I'm not sure you should choose the computer class Jessica, it's not very feminine!
	<<change_character DialogueManager Dad>>
	Don't be so hard on her, computer programming sounds pretty interesting.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Mum>>
	I'm just saying she should try something like cooking. It'll help her find a husband!
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	But I don't like cooking...
	<<change_character DialogueManager Dad>>
	We're here! Now don't be late to class!
