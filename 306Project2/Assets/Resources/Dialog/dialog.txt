Company Exec 1: Did you hear about that time machine that female engineer Jessica invented?
Company Exec 2: !?  Time Machine!? That must be very valuable.
Company Exec 1: We could make a lot of profit if we had the patent!
Company Exec 2: What if we stole it? We can go back in time and stop it before it happens!
Company Exec 1: If we stop her from becoming an engineer we can get the credit for inventing it.
Jessica: I need to save myself!

Jenny: Hey Jessica! Have you thought about what elective you want to do?
Jessica: I’m taking the electronics technology and programming classes!
Jenny: I wish I could do that, but I don’t think I’m good enough. So I’m taking the cooking class....
-> You are good enough
	Jessica: I believe you’re good enough! 
	Jenny: Really? That sounds hard.
	Jessica: Yes! Anyone can learn. And you can do it with me so you won’t be alone.
	Jenny: I’m excited to do it together!

-> Jessica: Agree
	Jessica: My parents said that I should do cooking too. 
	Jessica: At least it’ll be easy.

Grace: Making us pick electives this early feels rushed.
Jessica: I’ve already picked my options though! Electronics technology and programming.
Grace: You could be an engineer and invent things with those choices!
Jessica: Do you really think so?
Grace: You can do it!

Barry: What do you need the key for?
-> Professor Waston told me
	Jessica: Professor Waston told me that she dropped it here somewhere.
	Barry: We need more young women like you in engineering.
-> I want to go into the workshop
	Jessica: I want to go into the workshop.
	Barry: Sure thing.

Anderson: Hahaha. A girl thinking they can program.
Jessica: Excuse me?
Anderson: Look at you, you’re the only girl in the room!
-> So what?
	Jessica: So what? If I want to learn programming, I’m going to learn programming.
	Anderson: Do you really think so?
	Jessica: Yes.
	Anderson: I guess if you’re really that set on it...
-> Maybe
	Jessica: Maybe I’m a bit out of place.
	Anderson: Why don’t you go do art instead. Or be a nurse or teacher. Those are better for girls.

Owen: You don’t look like an engineer. Are you sure you’re in the right class?
-> Anyone can be an engineer
	Jessica: Anyone can be an engineer, you know. It’s rude to judge based on appearances.
	Owen: Girls are just hardworking, but boys are clever. So if you’ll excuse me, I have actual students to teach.
	Jessica: That’s a stereotype. Anyone can learn equally well.
	Owen: You should pick a more feminine subject. Engineering is just something that boys do.
	Jessica: Engineering isn’t just for boys. The first computer was created by a girl, Grace Hopper! And another girl, Hedy Lamarr, invented Wi-Fi.
	Owen: I guess that’s true...You’ve given me something to think about.
-> I’m in the right class
	Jessica: Yes, I’m in the right class.
	Owen: Girls are just hardworking, but boys are clever. So if you’ll excuse me, I have actual students to teach.
-> Um…
	Jessica: Um…
	Owen: Well, speak up, young lady.
	Jessica: I have to go, sorry.
	Owen: I think you’d make a great nurse or teacher. Those are better options for a girl than engineering.

Jessica: Sorry to bother you, Mrs…
Professor Waston: Call me Cathy. I’m an inventor and also your electronics technology teacher.
Jessica: I want to be an engineer, but so many people - my parents, teachers, friends - all say that girls shouldn’t be engineers.
Professor Waston: Don’t listen to them! Anyone can be an engineer.
Professor Waston: Being an engineer is more than calculations or computers. It’s about doing practical things to make the world a better place. You help people by inventing things.
Jessica: What should I do to become an engineer?
Professor Waston: Take all the science and maths classes you can! Physics, chemistry, digital and electronics technologies and programming. 
-> Thank you
	Jessica: Thank you.
	Professor Waston: I believe in you, Jessica.
-> Jenny
	Jessica: There’s a girl in my class who wants to do electronics technology too but doesn’t think she’s good enough.
	Professor Waston: Do you have any ideas for systemic change?
	-> Make mandatory courses
		Jessica: We could make electronics technology and programming mandatory.
		Professor Waston: That’s a great idea. If it’s mandatory, girls will find they’re actually good at it instead of never trying because other people tell them.
	-> Talk to her
		Jessica: Could you invite her personally? I think she would believe more in herself if you told her she could do it.
		Professor Waston: That’s a good idea. We’ll change beliefs one at a time.
	-> Girls-only class
		Jessica: We could organize a girls-only programming class.
		Professor Waston: That’s not a good idea long-term because it’s a form of segregation but still a way to encourage more girls to try it out! Good idea.
