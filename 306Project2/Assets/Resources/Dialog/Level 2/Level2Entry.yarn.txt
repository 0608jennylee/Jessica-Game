    Welcome everyone to the Engineering open day! Engineers make a positive difference in many aspects of our lives. 
    Their skills and knowledge have direct impacts on our living, health and wellbeing. 
    If you’re passionate about designing creative solutions to problems, then consider a career in engineering!
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    Finally here. This sounds exactly like what I want to do. I am getting really excited? How about you Jenny?
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jenny>>
    Engineering sounds to be the right choice. 
    I want to meet other girls who are thinking about engineering while we are here. 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jenny>>
    (Looking around) hmm… Can’t seem to see any other girls around. Seems we are the only girls in this room. :(
    Do you still want to stay and explore a bit more? 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    -> We will be fine! Let’s check out the department exhibitions.
    -> hm..maybe we should check out the other faulties instead?
       Let’s just hang out a bit more and see if more girls turn up.
