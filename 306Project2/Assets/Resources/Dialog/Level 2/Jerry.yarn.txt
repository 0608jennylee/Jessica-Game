    Hey! I am Jerry and this is Tom. 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    Hi! I am Jessica. 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Tom>>
    We have just started on the activity. So basically it is to use Lego to build a bridge between the two tables, 
    and there are some requirements that we have to meet: such as the bridge cannot use more than 70 pieces, 
    and cannot be taller than 40cm. 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jerry>>
    We have a fairly good idea of how to build the bridge already. Do you want to help us to draw our design and 
    write some documentations on this sheet of paper we have to fill in? 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    Okay.. I try do that first. If you need any help, I will try help.
    <<change_character DialogueManager Tom>>
    Cool! But pretty sure we will be fine.

    20 minutes passes...
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    [Inner thought]: Tom and Jerry look really stuck. I wonder if I should help, but they seemed rather confident before. 
    -> Ask if they need help. 
       Do you guys need any help? I have finished all the paper work. 
       <<change_character DialogueManager Tom>>
       That would be great. We are kind of stuck on how to link those two components here. 
       <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
       I see. Can I try? I think I have played with these before. 
       <<change_character DialogueManager Clock>>
       5 minutes passes...
       <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
       Yah! It's done! The bridge looks great!
       <<change_character DialogueManager Jerry>>
       Yah!! It looks so awesome! Sorry about our atitude before, 
       we've just always thought that girls are generally not good at any engineering related things. 
       Hope we could study civil together next year. 
       <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
       That's okay. Great meeting you guys. :D
       <<set $completedCivilActivity to true>> 
    -> Too awkward to ask. Stay quiet and wait a bit longer.

       5 minutes passes...
       <<change_character DialogueManager Alice>>
       Sorry guys, I'll have to ask you guys to pack up, we have a few other groups waiting as well. 
       <<change_character DialogueManager Tom>>
       Ahhh.. Such a shame, we just need a bit more time to figure out how to link those two components!
       <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
       [Inner throught]: I wish I asked earlier. I know how to do that..
       <<set $completedCivilActivity to true>> 
<<elseif $talkedToJerry is true>> 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jerry>>
    It was nice meeting you. 
<<else>> 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jerry>>
    Hi! We are kind of busy right now. let's talk later.
