    Hey! I am Jerry and this is Tom. 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    Hi! I am Jessica. 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Tom>>
    We have just started on the activity. So basically it is to use Lego to build a bridge between the two tables, 
    and there are some requirements that we have to meet: such as the bridge cannot use more than 70 pieces, 
    and cannot be taller than 40cm. 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jerry>>
    We have a fairly good idea of how to build the bridge already. Do you want to help us to draw our design and write
    some documentations on this sheet of paper we have to fill in? 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    Okay..
    <<change_character DialogueManager Tom>>
    Oh. Are you sure you want to do programming then? You know, us boys are usually better at programming. 
    You could probably check out the arts faculty. Itâ€™s right across the street.

    -> Maybe I will reconsider my options a bit.
