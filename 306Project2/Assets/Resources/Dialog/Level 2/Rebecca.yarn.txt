    Hello! I am Rebecca and this is my friend Zoe and Sam.
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    Hi! I am Jessica. Such a relieve to meet you guys. I thought I was the only girl here today.
    <<change_character DialogueManager Rebecca>>
    Nice meeting you as well! Yeah, my friends and I were getting really nervous to see no other girls are here as well. 
    But I heard there is a women in engineering social event soon. I think it would be great for us to attend.

        Oh! That sounds awesome! I will definitely go and have a look. 
        Do you know where it will be held? 
        <<change_character DialogueManager Rebecca>>
        I am not quite sure. But I am sure if you ask a volunteer here and they will tell you the details. 
        <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
        Cool! See you there then.

        Yeah! I heard this from the volunteer named Amy as well. I will see you there then.
