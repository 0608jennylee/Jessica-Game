   Cool! I can see that you have finished exploring the ECE display. 
   We also have the Cicl and Mechanical department on display. Which one do you want to explore next?
   -> Civil
      Cool! The Civil department is located at the study space.
      Come back after you finish and I will direct you to the Mechanical department.
      <<set $startCivil to true>> 
   -> Mechanical
      Cool! The Mechanical department is located upstairs.
      Come back after you finish and I will direct you to the Civil department.
      <<set $startMechanical to true>>
