    Awesome! That's all the departments that are on display today. Which department are you most interested in?
    -> Civil 
    -> Mechanical
    -> ECE 
    That's awesome. By the way, we also have a WEN event later if you are interested. 
    WEN refers to women in engineering which is a social network that builds communication between female engineers. 
    At today's event, new female students will get to know each other, 
    and WEN Leaders are also going to share their experience and top tips in Engineering.
