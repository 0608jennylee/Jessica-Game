    Hey! I am Tom. Are you thinking about going into ECE as well? 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    Yeah! ECE seems like a good choice to me.  
    <<change_character DialogueManager Tom>>
    Oh nice! What programming languages have you used? 
    I can use at least ten languages, been doing programming since primary school. 
    <<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
    I have never done programming before. Hopefully uni will teach from the basics.
    <<change_character DialogueManager Tom>>
    Oh. Are you sure you want to do programming then? You know, us boys are usually better at programming. 
    You could probably check out the arts faculty. Itâ€™s right across the street.
