        Well done for finding the last object! That was a tough one to find without any clue given. 
        Hope you enjoyed our little activity and is a bit more familiar with the Engineering building! 
        Excited to see you next year! 
        Let's all for Mechanical display. Make sure you talk to Amy for more info about other departments we have.

        That's all for our department. Please check out the other departments or Amy might have something for you.

        Well done for finding the grey gear!
        One final object to find is a white gear, and there is no clue.
        <<set $needWhiteGear to true>>

        The clue for the grey gear is "I know a bank where the wild Daisy blows, Where thy gear lays." Good luck!

        Nice, you got the black gear! 
        The next item to find is a grey gear.
        Have fun! 
        The clue is: "Up the greenwood tree, seek what thou find."

        Hi! I am Alex. Welcome to the Mecanical department!
        We boast a project-intensive curriculum that prepares you for the challenges of designing 
        and manufacturing advanced products and services for the 21st century.
        We currently have a scavenger hunt activity going on right now. Would you be interested in participating?

        Sure! I love scavenger hunt!

        Great! I will be asking you to find three objects around this building, and the first thing is a black gear!
        Here is a little clue for you:
