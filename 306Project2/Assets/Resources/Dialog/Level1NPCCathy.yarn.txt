	Sorry to bother you, Mrs…
	<<change_character DialogueManager Professor Waston>>
	Call me Cathy. I’m an inventor and also your electronics technology teacher.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	I want to be an engineer, but so many people - my parents, teachers, friends - all say that girls shouldn’t be engineers.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Professor Waston>>
	Don’t listen to them! Anyone can be an engineer.
	Being an engineer is more than calculations or computers. It’s about doing practical things to make the world a better place. You help people by inventing things.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	What should I do to become an engineer?
	<<change_character DialogueManager Professor Waston>>
	Take all the science and maths classes you can! Physics, chemistry, digital and electronics technologies and programming. 
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	-> Thank you
		Thank you.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Professor Waston>>
		I believe in you, Jessica.

	-> Jenny wants to do electronics technology too, but... <<if $talkedToJenny is true>>
		There’s a girl in my class who wants to do electronics technology too but doesn’t think she’s good enough.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Professor Waston>>
		Do you have any ideas to change people's attitudes permanently (systemic change)?
		<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
		-> Make electronics technology and programming mandatory.
			We could make electronics technology and programming mandatory.
			<<change_character DialogueManager Professor Waston>>
			That’s a great idea. If it’s mandatory, girls will do it find they’re actually good at it instead of never trying because other people tell them they can't do it.

		-> Could you invite her personally?
			Could you invite her personally? I think she would believe more in herself if you told her she could do it.
			<<change_character DialogueManager Professor Waston>>
			That’s a good idea. We’ll change beliefs one at a time.
			<<change_confidence Player 15>>
			<<transition Player CongratulationsScene>>
		-> Organize a girls-only programming class.
			We could organize a girls-only programming class.
			<<change_character DialogueManager Professor Waston>>
			That’s not a good idea long-term because it doesn't change society's biases, but it's still a way to encourage more girls to try it out in an inclusive environment! Good idea.
