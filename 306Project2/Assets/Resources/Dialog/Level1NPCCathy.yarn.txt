	Jessica: Sorry to bother you, Mrs…
	Professor Waston: Call me Cathy. I’m an inventor and also your electronics technology teacher.
	Jessica: I want to be an engineer, but so many people - my parents, teachers, friends - all say that girls shouldn’t be engineers.
	Professor Waston: Don’t listen to them! Anyone can be an engineer.
	Professor Waston: Being an engineer is more than calculations or computers. It’s about doing practical things to make the world a better place. You help people by inventing things.
	Jessica: What should I do to become an engineer?
	Professor Waston: Take all the science and maths classes you can! Physics, chemistry, digital and electronics technologies and programming. 
	-> Thank you
		Jessica: Thank you.
		Professor Waston: I believe in you, Jessica.

	-> Jenny wants to do electronics technology too, but... <<if $talkedToJenny is true>>
		Jessica: There’s a girl in my class who wants to do electronics technology too but doesn’t think she’s good enough.
		Professor Waston: Do you have any ideas to change people's attitudes permanently (systemic change)?
		-> Make electronics technology and programming mandatory.
			Jessica: We could make electronics technology and programming mandatory.
			Professor Waston: That’s a great idea. If it’s mandatory, girls will do it find they’re actually good at it instead of never trying because other people tell them they can't do it.

		-> Could you invite her personally?
			Jessica: Could you invite her personally? I think she would believe more in herself if you told her she could do it.
			Professor Waston: That’s a good idea. We’ll change beliefs one at a time.

		-> Organize a girls-only programming class.
			Jessica: We could organize a girls-only programming class.
			Professor Waston: That’s not a good idea long-term because it doesn't change society's biases, but it's still a way to encourage more girls to try it out in an inclusive environment! Good idea.
