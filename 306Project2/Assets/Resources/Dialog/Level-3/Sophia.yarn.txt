<<change_character DialogueManager Sophia>>
why do you ask?
<<change_character DialogueManager Sophia>>
Do you think i should continue working here?
I don't know you that well, but i can tell Sam hasn't been treating you nicely.
Let me tell you, all the things you go through now, let them be experiences in making you better.
Printing documents and coffee may sound tedious now but it'll help you with your management and also make good coffee - those late nights wont go well without them.
If you don't feel like you're putting your skills to work, put your name down for project Xunil or Swindows and you can work with me.
I'll make sure we utilise those skills you have. 
I was also once Sams errand girl, but I just preserved and kept working hard, and slowly got acknowledgement from all my colleagues.
You'll eventually get there don't let anything get to you, everything is a part of the big picture.
