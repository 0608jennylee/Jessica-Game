		Hey Cathy, I'm allocating the teams for the projects. Do you have a preference?
		<<change_character DialogueManager Cathy>>
		I don't want to do the Xunil project. Can you put me on a team with Sophia. I really want to work with her.
		She's working on a holographic display system, if I work with her now then I might be able to work with her in the future.
	<<else>>
		we talked already. Make sure I'm on Sophia's team
	<<endif>>
<<else>>
	The devil's in a bad mood, better start working
