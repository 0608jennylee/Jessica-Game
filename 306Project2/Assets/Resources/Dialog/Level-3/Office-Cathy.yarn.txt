		Hey Cathy, I'm allocating the teams for the projects.
		Do you have a preference?
		<<change_character DialogueManager Cathy>>
		I don't want to do the X project. 
		Can you put me on a team with Sophia.
		I really want to work with her.
		She's working on a holographic display system, if I work with her now then I might be able to work with her in the future.
	<<else>>
		we talked already. Make sure I'm on Sophia's team
