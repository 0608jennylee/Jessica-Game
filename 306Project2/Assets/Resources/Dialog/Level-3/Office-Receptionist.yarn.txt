	Hi Beryl, can you give me the details of the 3 projects for today's meeting minutes
	<<change_character DialogueManager Secretary Beryl>>
	We have 3 projects, the first is the Xunil project, Swodniw project and hsotnicam project. 
	We need to allocate our 4 team members to each project, 
	they all have preferences on which one to work on, so can you talk to them and then allocate them to a team, 
	of course, you can't satisfy everyone, but try to keep to their preferences as possible.
	to allocate them, you need to log them onto my laptop and then tell Sam and Sophia.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	Ok thanks.
<<else>>
	<<change_character DialogueManager Secretary Beryl>>
	You should get back to work, theres a lot of things to do

	Oh no, the receptionist isn't letting me talk to Sophia,
	If I don't talk to Sophia, I can't start working on projects with her.
	But I'm not in Sophia's team right now. She might not want to talk to me.
	I need to get my work done and then talk to Sophia.
