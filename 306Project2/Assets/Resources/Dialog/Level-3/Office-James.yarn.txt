	Hey Jessica, I heard you had an internship from Elgoog.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	Yes, I had an internship there when I was still in uni.
	<<change_character DialogueManager James>>
	Was this internship through the Women's program
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	I got it through the diversity program
	<<change_character DialogueManager James>>
	Oh
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	Is something wrong?
	<<change_character DialogueManager James>>
	I was just thinking how lucky you were for being a women and getting an internship for being a female.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	The point of diversity programs is to fight historical oppression of females in tech. 
	We all ended up with the same job. I got into Elgoog because of my skills and abilities not my gender.
	<<change_character DialogueManager James>>
	I'm very sorry if I offended you
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	It's fine, I'm glad that you asked me that.
	I've always thought I was priviliged as I have received a lot of comments in the past like that.
	Discouraging classmates and Discouraging lecturers. I thank you all for making those comments, 
	but those comments will only make me stronger.
	I have been receiving support from my teachers, lecturers, friends and colleagues 
	but that is because I've been working hard all this time to get to here now.
	I work harder than anyone around me, not just because I am competitive, 
	but also because I don't want my efforts to be unacknowledged because I am a female.
	<<change_character DialogueManager James>>
	I'm very sorry, I never knew you were so hardworking, no wonder you got employee of the month and the internship
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	It's ok, It was great talking to you.
	<<change_character DialogueManager James>>
	Do you really think that?...
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	Yes, it was great, I really like to tell people more about my story and how hardworking the people around us are.
	It allows for me to change one person at a time and it will eventually reach more people,
	and more people will be able to understand us(systematic change).
	<<change_character DialogueManager James>>
	<<change_confidence Player 10>>
	It's really great that you are doing that. I respect you for that and also for standing up to me like that, brave and strong.
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	Thank you.
