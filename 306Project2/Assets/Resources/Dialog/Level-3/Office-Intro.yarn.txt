	Oh no! I'm back to the office. This was my first graduate job.
	I was only able to do tedious work here. The boss didn't think I would be able to do anything useful.
	I couldn't utilise my skills. Everything was terrible here.
	Until I met Sophia. I need to go and talk to her.
	I need to make sure she helps me find my place here.
