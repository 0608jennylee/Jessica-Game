	Oh no! I'm back to the office. This was my first graduate job.
	I was only able to do tedious work here. The boss didn't think I would be able to do anything useful.
	I couldn't utilise my skills. Everything was terrible here.
	Until I met Sophia. I need to go and talk to her.
	I need to make sure she helps me find my place here.

	The company has sent some people back in time to stop me!
	You need to avoid their auras or remove the company's influence!
	They have made it more difficult since the last attempt, 
	their new power is to force you to use the left and right arrow keys to climb levels. 
	and once you reach the top then you can clear the aura.
	If you fail to do so you will lose one point of energy.
	If you lose all your points of energy you will be sent back to the future!
