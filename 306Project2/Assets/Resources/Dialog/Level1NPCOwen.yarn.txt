	You don’t look like an engineer. Are you sure you’re in the right class?
	<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
	-> Anyone can be an engineer
		Anyone can be an engineer, you know. It’s rude to judge based on appearances.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Owen>>
		Girls are just hardworking, but boys are clever. So if you’ll excuse me, I have actual students to teach.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
		That’s a stereotype. Anyone can learn equally well.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Owen>>
		You should pick a more feminine subject. Engineering is just something that boys do.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
		Engineering isn’t just for boys. The first computer was created by a girl, Grace Hopper! And another girl, Hedy Lamarr, invented Wi-Fi.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Owen>>
		I guess that’s true...You’ve given me something to think about.

	-> I’m in the right class
		Yes, I’m in the right class.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Owen>>
		Girls are just hardworking, but boys are clever. So if you’ll excuse me, I have actual students to teach.

	-> Um…
		Um…
		<<change_character DialogueManager Owen>>
		Well, speak up, young lady.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Jessica>>
		On second thoughts, I have to go, sorry.
		<<change_character DialogueManager Owen>>
		I think you’d make a great nurse or teacher. Those are better options for a girl than engineering.
