	Owen: You don’t look like an engineer. Are you sure you’re in the right class?
	-> Anyone can be an engineer
		Jessica: Anyone can be an engineer, you know. It’s rude to judge based on appearances.
		Owen: Girls are just hardworking, but boys are clever. So if you’ll excuse me, I have actual students to teach.
		Jessica: That’s a stereotype. Anyone can learn equally well.
		Owen: You should pick a more feminine subject. Engineering is just something that boys do.
		Jessica: Engineering isn’t just for boys. The first computer was created by a girl, Grace Hopper! And another girl, Hedy Lamarr, invented Wi-Fi.
		Owen: I guess that’s true...You’ve given me something to think about.

		Jessica: Yes, I’m in the right class.
		Owen: Girls are just hardworking, but boys are clever. So if you’ll excuse me, I have actual students to teach.

	-> Um…
		Jessica: Um…
		Owen: Well, speak up, young lady.
		Jessica: I have to go, sorry.
		Owen: I think you’d make a great nurse or teacher. Those are better options for a girl than engineering.
